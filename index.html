    <h1>Hi, I'm Raul</h1>
    <h3>CyberSec Student</h3>     
    <p>and I go by the codename "raullexe." I am a 17-year-old from Azerbaijan with a deep passion 
        for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Ever since I was young, I've been captivated by computers 
        and their vulnerabilities, which led me to explore the intriguing world of cybersecurity.
        I am currently focused on learning about cyber defense and ethical hacking. It's a field that 
        fascinates me, and I've been actively engaging in self-directed learning and online courses to 
        expand my knowledge and skills. I'm particularly interested in areas such as network security, 
        vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and digital forensics.
        Despite my age, I have already achieved some noteworthy milestones in the realm of cybersecurity. 
        I have participated in various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, where I honed my problem-solving 
        abilities and demonstrated a knack for analyzing complex systems. Through these experiences, I 
        have developed a strong ability to identify security flaws and implement effective countermeasures.
        My journey as a young cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker is characterized by my unwavering 
        dedication and thirst for knowledge. With my technical expertise, ethical mindset, and passion for 
        securing the digital world, I am determined to become a formidable force in the field ofÂ cybersecurity.
